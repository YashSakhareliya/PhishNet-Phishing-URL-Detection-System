## Project Description
PhishNet is a web-based application that predicts whether a given URL is safe or a phishing attack. Built using the **Streamlit** framework, the application leverages a pre-trained **Random Forest** model to provide accurate predictions.

## Features
- **Input URL**: Enter a URL to analyze its safety.
- **Prediction**: Provides a result indicating whether the URL is safe or phishing.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **Random Forest Model**: Machine learning algorithm used for predictions.
- **Pandas & Scikit-Learn**: For data processing and model development.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YashSakhareliya/PhishNet-Phishing-URL-Detection-System.git
   cd PhishNet-Phishing-URL-Detection-System
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
